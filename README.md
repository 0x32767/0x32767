Hello, I am a CS student and enjoy many github-worthey things, such as: ethical hacking, reverse engeneering and ocasional programming projects.

At the moment I am working on [EOSDcomp](https://github.com/wearrrrr/EoSDecomp) a decompilation effort, in addition to learning a ton more about the C++ compiler. I am also good friends with [Topscientist](https://github.com/Topscientist) and am a member of @SocialCabin. I also speek German and English.

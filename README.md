It's KoiKoi4, your favorite `further maths` and `computer science` student. I do my best to have high coding standards, maximizing: **efficiency**, **elegance** and **maintainability**. I use primarily python, but have learned the rudimentary basics of C-Style languages, mainly being javascript.

My current goals are to complete all **BIO** papers from 2006 to 2025, the repo should be available.

<summary>My Programming Hot-Takes</summary>

 * There are three kinds of developers, low level devs who only use linux and speak in `rust` or `C`, hobby developers who code for the sake of it and `hustlers` who only know `react` or `next`.
 * If rust is so safe why does `unsafe {}` exist?
 * JS was made for the web and should stay in the web.
 * Python has gotten 10% - 20% faster in the last few updates it's not that slow anymore.
 * Vibe coding sucks, it's what you do if you enjoy not understanding "your code".
